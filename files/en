It was a warm evening in the village.;images/1.jpg;files/sounds-en/1.wav
It was very hot and most of the windows were open.;images/2.jpg;files/sounds-en/2.wav
Paul was fast asleep when suddenly...;images/3.jpg;files/sounds-en/3.wav
An Anopheles mosquito landed on his window frame! The mosquito already had the Malaria parasite.;images/4.jpg;files/sounds-en/4.wav
In the dark the mosquito found Paul's hand and bit him. Paul was now infected with Malaria.;images/6.jpg;files/sounds-en/6.wav
The parasite travelled through his blood and into his liver.;images/7.jpg;files/sounds-en/7.wav
Soon it started spreading out all over his body and it made him ill.;images/8.jpg;files/sounds-en/8.wav
The Malaria parasite grows inside each red blood cell. A few parasites grow into many more.;images/9.jpg;files/sounds-en/9.wav
Parasites go back into the mosquito the next time it bites a person who has Malaria.;images/10.jpg;files/sounds-en/10.wav
When you have Malaria, you can get headaches.;images/11.jpg;files/sounds-en/11.wav
You can get aching muscles and pain in the joints.;images/12.jpg;files/sounds-en/12.wav
You can get a fever or start sweating.;images/13.jpg;files/sounds-en/13.wav
Malaria can give you chills and shivers.;images/14.jpg;files/sounds-en/14.wav
Malaria can make you feel tired.;images/15.jpg;files/sounds-en/15.wav
Malaria may give you a stomach ache...;images/16.jpg;files/sounds-en/16.wav
..or make breathing difficult;images/18.jpg;files/sounds-en/18.wav
In some rare cases the colour of the eyes go from white to yellow...;images/17.jpg;files/sounds-en/17.wav
Paul was clever and knew that he had Malaria. So he told his mum and she took him to the doctor to get medicine.;images/19.jpg;files/sounds-en/19.wav
Paul was feeling better and told his friend Jane about his illness.;images/20.jpg;files/sounds-en/20.wav
Now Paul sleeps under a mosquito bed net to stop the mosquitos from biting him.;images/22.jpg;files/sounds-en/22.wav
Paul's mum put the bednet in insecticide every few months to keep it working. Only adults should use insecticide.;images/23.jpg;files/sounds-en/23.wav
There are now screens on the door and window to stop mosquitoes coming in.;images/24.jpg;files/sounds-en/24.wav
Paul also wears long sleeved clothes between sunset and sunrise. This makes it harder for mosquitoes to bite him.;images/25.jpg;files/sounds-en/25.wav
